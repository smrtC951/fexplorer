FExplorer Demo 1.2 Update is here! (September 27, 2025)
Updates
- New pages, such as placeholder
- New design for FExplorer Create!
- Bug fixes, but more bugs appear out of nowhere
- New games page, with upcoming games coming to you!
- Settings have been added, but functionality will come later!
- New placeholder icons for FExplorer! Some of them are.
- Brand new feature - Random user pages! (They're really good)
- Risk it all! (On FExplorer Finances!)

I genuinely am glad that I released this update now because there will be A LOT more content along the way!
See ya!
